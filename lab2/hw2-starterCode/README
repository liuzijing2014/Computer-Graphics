Zijing Liu CSCI-420 HW #1

How to compile:
	
	under ./zijing_liu_hw1/hw1-starterCode/ folder, run make

How to run: 
	
	under ./zijing_liu_hw1/hw1-starterCode/ folder, run ./hw1 <heightmap image> <texturemap image>

	The third second argument <texturemap image> is optional. If given, please make sure it has the exact same size as the given heightmap image.


Implemented Required Features:

	1.Use the OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher, and shader-based OpenGL. 

	2. Handle at least a 256x256 image for your height field at interactive frame rates (window size of 1280x720). Height field manipulations should run smoothly.
	
	3. Be able to render the height field as points, lines ("wireframe"), or solid triangles (with keys for the user to switch between the three).
	
	4. Render as a perspective view, utilizing GL's depth buffer for hidden surface removal.
	
	5. Use input from the mouse to rotate the heightfield using OpenGLMatrix::Rotate.
	
	6. Use input from the mouse to move the heightfield using OpenGLMatrix::Translate.
	
	7. Use input from the mouse to change the dimensions of the heightfield using OpenGLMatrix::Scale.
	
	8. Color the vertices using some smooth gradient. Grayscale is acceptable, but the grayscale value must vary smoothly across the heightfield.
	
	9. Be reasonably commented and written in an understandable manner--we will read your code.

Implemented Extra Credits:

	1. Use element arrays and glDrawElements.

	2. Support color (ImageIO::getBytesPerPixel == 3) in input images. (example: ./hw1 heightmap/isto_top_fodar_slice21-300x300.jpg )

	3. Color the vertices based on color values taken from another image of equal size. However, your code should still also support smooth gradients as per the core requirements. (example: ./hw1 heightmap/OhioPyle-256.jpg heightmap/fc_barcelona.jpg )

Renderring Instructions:

	Render as lines: Press L key
